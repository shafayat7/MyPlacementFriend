    <div class="hd1">TECHNICAL PROJECTS</div>
    <p>When you go for an interview in a big tech company, the focus of the interviewer will be on your personal projects. This will show them that you take initiatives from your side to work outside your college syllabus. It shows that you are resourceful, creative and would go out of your way for personal growth. So, in your third year, try to at least work on 2 technical projects – be it building a website, an Android app, etc.</p>

    <h3>Data Base</h3>
    <p>Most of the software that we write is backed up on a data-storage system. Many of the challenges faced by tech people arise when figuring out how to most efficiently retrieve and store data for future use. Amazon has been at the forefront of the non-relational DB movement. We have made Amazon Web Services such as DynamoDB available to the developer community so that they can easily leverage the benefits of non-relational databases. While we don't expect any particular level of expertise in non-relational databases, you should be familiar with general database concepts and their applications. The more you know about trade-offs between relational and non-relational databases, the better prepared you will be.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>Operating System</h3>
    <p>You don’t need to know how to build your own operating system from scratch, but you should be familiar with some OS topics that can affect code performance (e.g. memory management, processes, threads, synchronisation, paging and multithreading).</p>

    <h3>Database Design and SQL</h3>
    <p>As a software developer, working with a relational database is a critical skill that you’ll need, and it will stick with you no matter where you are in your career. Every company from small to large uses a DBMS, so it’s likely that you will come across different data models, type so databases (NoSQL and SQL), and dependencies on various companies.</p>

    <h3>SDLC model</h3>
    <p>Software Development life cycle (SDLC) is a spiritual model used in project management that defines the stages include in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study to the maintenance of the completed application.There are different software development life cycle models specify and design, which are followed during the software development phase. These models are also called "Software Development Process Models." Each process model follows a series of phase unique to its type to ensure success in the step of software development.</p>

    <div class="hd3">DSA PRACTICE</div>
    <h3>Data Structure</h3>
    <p>Most of the work we do involves storing and providing access to data in efficient ways. This requires a strong background in data structures. You’ll need to understand the inner workings of common data structures and be able to compare and contrast their use in various applications. You will be expected to know the runtimes for common operations as well as how they use memory.</p>
    <p>Algorithms You do not need to learn algorithms by heart for your interview. However, having a good understanding of the most common algorithms will probably make solving some of the questions a lot easier. Consider revising common algorithms such as traversals, divide and conquer, breadth-first search vs. depth-first search and make sure you understand the trade-offs for each. Knowing the runtimes, theoretical limitations and basic implementation strategies of different classes of algorithms is more important than memorising the specific details of any given algorithm.</p>

    <div class="hd4">APTITUDE PREPARATION</div>
    <p>Aptitude tests are an underestimated part of the placement procedure. While you might be technically skilled, there is a chance that you may falter while taking the aptitude test. Start practising really well for aptitude tests. Try to maximize your speed in the logic and quantitative aptitude sections. Read a lot of English newspapers to tackle the verbal section. Start solving CAT question papers to master Aptitude tests.</p>
    <div class="hd4">INTERVIEW PREPARATION</div>
    <p>You can start preparing for interviews when you are in the 3rd year. Read up on the placement stories of successful candidates to find out about the questions that they had to face. Try to understand the unique-factor in their replies that got them a job in companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook. Interviews, in general, can be scary. You tend to get nervous. So, conduct mock interviews with friends to ease out the pressure when it’s time to sit before an actual interviewer.Being able to communicate effectively is perhaps the most important of all life skills. It is what enables us to pass information to other people, and to understand what is said to us. You only have to watch a baby listening intently to its mother and trying to repeat the sounds that she makes to understand how fundamental is the urge to communicate.

    <div class="hd1">GROUP DISCUSSIONS</div>
    <p>When you go for an interview in a big tech company, the focus of the interviewer will be on your personal projects. This will show them that you take initiatives from your side to work outside your college syllabus. It shows that you are resourceful, creative and would go out of your way for personal growth. So, in your third year, try to at least work on 2 technical projects – be it building a website, an Android app, etc.</p>
    <div class="hd1">INTERNSHIPS</div>
    <p>While the pressure is quite high during your college years, it will benefit you if you start an internship at a good company. As an intern, you get a much more in-depth knowledge of how your ‘education’ is applied in the real world. It’s a great update for your CV too. Plus, you get to meet new people and create a network. If you do well in the company, you might even be offered a pre-placement offer even before you graduate. </p>
    <p>When it comes to internships, it is important to understand the kind of company you should do one with. Should you do an internship at a startup or an enterprise? Well, there are two ways to look at it. By having an internship with a startup, you demonstrate enthusiasm and zeal. However, with large enterprises, you can demonstrate professionalism and meticulous behavior. The right thing to do here would be to balance it out. We all know that you need to have 2-3 internships on your CV. You can keep it as a mixture of internship with a startup, one with a big enterprise company, and one research fellowship at a reputed university if it’s something that interests you.</p>

    <div class="hd4">BUILD RESUME</div>
    <p>Always keep your CV updated. If you have won a prize in a coding competition or are pursuing an additional technical course, write it in your CV. It should have all the information about your personal projects and internships too.RESUME plays a vital role in our placement.So always try to add weight to our RESUME.</p>
